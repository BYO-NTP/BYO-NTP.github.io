This sites main goal is to encourage new Stratum 1 NTP server builds. We do this by providing:

1. easy to follow instructions
2. timely information
3. links to additional resources

The [BYO-NTP search](https://byo-ntp.github.io/recipes/) tool catalogs and references many DIY Stratum 1 NTP server builds. It provides links to the build instructions.

The [BYO-NTP wiki](https://github.com/BYO-NTP/recipes/wiki) is chockablock full of information relevant to building NTP servers, build recipes, and building blocks of the NTP build recipes.

To contribute to this site, please see the [DEVELOP](DEVELOP.md) page.

The first feature of this GitHub repo is the [BYO-NTP search](https://byo-ntp.github.io/recipes/) tool, which attempts to catalog and reference the many DIY Stratum 1 NTP server builds. It provides links to the wiki pages which detail how to replicate a build.

The [BYO-NTP wiki](https://github.com/BYO-NTP/recipes/wiki) is chockablock full of information relevant to building NTP servers, build recipes, and building blocks of the build recipes.
